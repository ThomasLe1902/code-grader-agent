Generate a concise project description by analyzing this file tree.

File Tree:

Instructions:
1. Identify the project type (Frontend/Backend/AI/Full-stack)
2. Specify frameworks and technologies (e.g., Vite, FastAPI, Node.js, React)
3. Determine project architecture/structure
4. Note any distinctive patterns or features

Create a 3-5 sentence description that clearly identifies the project's nature, tech stack, and purpose to help determine code evaluation relevance.

1. Identify key code elements present (functions, classes, tests, etc.)
2. Determine which criteria directly apply to these elements
3. Note: All code files can be evaluated for standards like naming conventions, but specialized criteria (testing, security) only apply to relevant files

0 - if file can be meaningfully evaluated against <50% of criteria
