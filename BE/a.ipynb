This is a good practice. However, refactoring may be needed if the same error handling logic appears in multiple places.\\n\\n- **Code Consistency:** Overall, the coding style is consistent. However, there is a risk of inconsistency with the use of the `suggestionsURL` variable in the `fetchSuggestions` callback, which should be included in `useCallback` dependencies.\\n\\n- **No Unnecessary Code:** The code is free from unused imports, logs, or old comments, which makes it cleaner. The useEffect cleanups are crucial to ensure that no memory leaks occur in practical applications. This component does not use `useEffect`, which is fine as long as state is managed correctly.\",\n",
